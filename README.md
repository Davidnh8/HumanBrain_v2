# HumanBrain_v2

Part of my PHYS 598 thesis at University of Calgary.  
There exists beliefs that Consciousness, in a sense, is quite small, that is, when translated into bits, information needed to generate the conscious flow it is less than 100 bits/s [Chapter 14, Human Physiology]
Thus the aim of this project is to obtain the connectome of the human brain (comprehensive neural map of the brain), and then using empirical measurements, estimate the information flow into various brain regions such as the superior colliculus, which is hypothesized to be the seat of consciousness[Stanislas Dehaene, Consciousness and the Brain Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts.]

Using Public Brain Data from Human Connectome Database (https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm). 

Probabilistic Tractography was used on Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Image data((https://db.humanconnectome.org/app/template/Login.vm).
Together with structural data, label to label streamlines were counted.
